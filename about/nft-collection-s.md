# ðŸ¥· NFT collection(s)

## Fighters

The main NFT collection is comprised of the individual fighters, the Acolytes. Each fighter comes with a set of traits that determine his predispositions for mastering each of the five elements. The fighters are recruited by Masters who are always on a lookout to expand their clans.

When a fighter joins a clan, he can begin his combat journey. By participating in quests, duels and tournaments he can earn experience points and Taels. The experience points allow him to level-up and earn new attribute points that can be used to increase the proficiency in the elements of his Master's choice. The Taels can be used to unlock new fighter's skills, redistribute his attribute points or purchase items in the marketplace.

## Arenas

The secondary NFT collection comprises of arenas, within which the duels take place. Each arena comes with a set of traits that determine its affinity towards each of the five elements. While the arenas are static (do not level-up like fighters do), they are still invaluable to clans as they allow the fighters to train faster, allow one to start new battles on home ground and provide additional source of income to the Masters.
