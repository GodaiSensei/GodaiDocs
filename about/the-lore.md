# üåè The lore

## Introduction

In the vast expanse of the Solana multiverse lies a mysterious realm known as Godai. The blockchain vagabonds that have came across it tell stories of a untamed land full of natural wonders and breathtaking beauty. The Godai‚Äôs landscape is defined by ancient mountains that stand tall and strong besides the fiery volcanoes that have given rise to the mountain range throughout the eons. In the surrounding valleys one can find lush forests that are teeming with life and provide the energy for the raging fires of the volcanoes above. The forest themselves are nurtured by the pristine rivers and lakes of the land. As the streams make their way down from the mountains in a series of breathtaking waterfalls, they are enriched with esoteric metals that are more precious than gold. It truly is a spectacular harmony of the five elements: **Earth, Fire, Wood, Water and Metal.**

But there is more to Godai than meets the eye. Within the sanctuaries and temples that are scattered across the land lives a thriving community of eager adventurers. They are determined to train their body & mind and master the mystical powers that shape the world of Godai. Countless centuries ago a legendary master, today only known by his honorable title ‚ÄúGrand Sensei‚Äù, has discovered a hidden wellspring of energy deep within the abyss of the spiritual realm. This energy, known as "**Chi"**, has the power to transform ordinary individuals into extraordinary martial artists and give them the control over the five elements. The Grand Sensei's teachings have became the foundation for a renowned community of martial artists that call themselves **the Acolytes**.

## The way of an Acolyte

To become a respectful Acolyte, the disciples must devote themselves to a lifelong journey of self-improvement. They train tirelessly under the guidance of wise masters, learning the secrets of combat, the art of focus, and the harmony between the body and mind. From the tranquil gardens of ancient monasteries to the breathtaking waterfalls hidden high in the mountains, these sacred training grounds are where legends are forged.

Acolytes are not just warriors; they are guardians of the commoners. To prove their worthiness, they embark on quests to aid those in need, by protecting villages from marauding bandits and eradicating evil spirits from their hidden lairs. Through these selfless acts, they cultivate not only their strength but also earn **"Taels"**, the common currency of Godai that is invaluable for expediting their training.

Skirmishes and clashes are a rite of passage for any aspiring martial artist. Acolytes test their skills against one another in honorable combat, forging bonds of friendship and respect even in the heat of battle. These encounters are not just tests of martial prowess but also tests of character and honor.

The pinnacle of an Acolyte's journey are the grand martial arts tournament, where the most skilled and disciplined warriors from across the Godai gather to compete. It is here that destinies are decided, rivalries are settled, and champions emerge. The winner not only earns fame and glory but also precious rewards.

## The Sensei's legacy

After the Grand Sensei formulated his teachings he mysteriously disappeared. This brought an era of instability and chaos into the land of Godai. Numerous brave champions have attempted to fill the void, but no single warrior was powerful enough to claim the title of Grand Sensei and restore the balance. Therefore, the Acolytes began joining up into **clans** under the control of knowledgeable and wise men, known as the **Masters**.

Today there exists a myriad of clans and anyone eager to become a Masters can establish a clan of his own. Through this plurality the natural balance is thankfully restored, but it comes at a price. Due to the fierce temperament of warriors and their lust for power, there is a constant competition between the clans. According to the ancient tradition, each season a successor of the Grand Sensei is selected based on the performance of his clan in clashes and tournaments. Winning the title allows the Master and his clan to occupy the Temple of Elements that was established by the Grand Sensei himself. Apart from the ultimate glory, this bestows the clan with boundless riches that have accumulated in the temple's coffers.
