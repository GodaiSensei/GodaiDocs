# üåè The lore

## Introduction

In a mystical land, where lush forests meet towering vulcanism, cascading waterfalls cut their way through ancient mountains full of esoteric ores, a realm of extraordinary power and potential awaits. This world, known as **Godai**, is a breathtaking fusion of natural beauty and supernatural wonder, where young disciples yearn to ascend to greatness as world-class martial artists.

Countless centuries ago, a legendary master, known only as the "Grand Sensei," discovered a hidden wellspring of energy deep within the depths of the spiritual realm. This energy, known as "**Chi"**, has the power to transform ordinary individuals into extraordinary martial artists and give them the control over the five elements: **Earth, Fire, Wood, Water and Metal**. The Grand Sensei's wisdom and teachings became the foundation upon which the Acolytes' path was built.

## The way of an Acolyte

To become a respectful Acolyte, the disciples must devote themselves to a lifelong journey of self-improvement. They train tirelessly under the guidance of wise masters, learning the secrets of combat, the art of focus, and the harmony between mind, body, and spirit. From the tranquil gardens of ancient monasteries to the breathtaking waterfalls hidden high in the mountains, these sacred training grounds are where legends are forged.

Acolytes are not just warriors; they are guardians of the commoners. To prove their worthiness, they embark on quests to aid those in need, by protecting villages from marauding bandits and eradicating evil spirits from their hidden lairs. Through these selfless acts, they cultivate not only their strength but also earn **"Taels"**, the common currency that is invaluable for expediting their training.

Challenges and duels are a rite of passage for any aspiring martial artist. Acolytes test their skills against one another in honorable combat, forging bonds of friendship and respect even in the heat of battle. These encounters are not just tests of martial prowess but also tests of character and honor.

The pinnacle of an Acolyte's journey is the grand martial arts tournament, where the most skilled and disciplined warriors from across the Godai gather to compete. It is here that destinies are decided, rivalries are settled, and champions emerge. The winner not only earns fame and glory but also the precious rewards.

## The Sensei's legacy

After the Grand Sensei formulated the Acolytes' codex he mysteriously disappeared. This brought an era of instability and chaos into the land of Godai. Numerous brave champions have attempted to fill the void, but no single warrior was powerful enough to take his place and restore the balance. Therefore, the Acolytes began joining up into **clans** under the control of knowledgeable and wise men, known as the **Masters**.

Today there exists a myriad of clans and anyone eager to become a Masters can establish a clan of his own. Through this plurality the natural balance is thankfully restored, but it comes at a price. Due to the fierce temperament of warriors and their lust for power, there is a constant competition between the clans. According to the ancient tradition, each season a successor of the Grand Sensei is selected based on the performance of his clan in duels and tournaments. Winning the title allows the Master and his clan to occupy the _\[name]_ temple that was built by the Grand Sensei himself. Apart from the ultimate glory, this bestows the clan with unimaginable riches that have accumulated in the temple's coffers.
