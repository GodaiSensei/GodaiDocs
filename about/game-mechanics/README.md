# ðŸŽ® Game mechanics

## Overview

Each user takes the role of a Master and controls over his clan. The clan consists of fighters and arena NFTs that he owns and chooses to enlist. Even if the Master does not own any of the Acolytes NFTs, he can still participate in battles by renting the NFTs from other users, albeit that requires him to pay a small fee to the owner.

The game allows the players to pursue different goals. Depending on the user's disposition, he can either choose to pursue glory by competing in the clan leaderboard, focus on maximizing his earnings through P2E aspects, enjoy the immersive lore through the endless series of unique quests or any combination of the above.

## Game modes

The game allows users to participate through active battles or passive staking. The transition between the game modes is seamless and the players can easily adapt their gaming style to the amount of time that they currently have at their disposal.

### Battles

All battles within the game are duels between a fighter and a computer-controlled enemy (PvE) or between two fighters (PvP). All battles takes place in an arena, which determines the environments affinity to each of the five elements. However, there are important differences between different battle type and their rewards.

Upon joining the battle, the user needs to choose which fighter he wishes to deploy (can be either a fighter enlisted in his clan or other user's fighter that is available for rent). For the selected fighter he then needs to specify the **build**, which consists of a **sequence of actions** and a **set of skills**. Each action is associated with one of the five elements and the clash of the two sequences dictates the course of the battle. The chosen set of skills augments the actions when certain criteria are met. More details can be found in:

### Staking

Apart from battles that require active involvement of the user, the game supports also passive game modes, commonly dubbed staking. The Acolytes offers two types of staking, namely meditation and renting. Meditation allows the clan to accumulate addition Chi and Taels over time, while renting allows the user to earn through fees by lending his NFTs to other users. For more details see:
