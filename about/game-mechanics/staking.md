Actively engaging in battles offers the fastest way for Masters to earn glory and riches. However, the exists also another path, more suitable for those who wish to grow while being absent from the realm of \[name]. This is enabled either by entering a deep state of meditation or rent out your fighters and arenas to other users.

## Meditation

Meditation allows fighters to earn experience points, taels and chi over time. While being in the state of meditation they can not participate in battles or be rented to other players. Furthermore, entering the state of meditation requires certain **warmup** time, while upon exiting the state of meditation the fighter can not enter again untill the **cooldown** period has elapsed. However, note that the meditation rewards can be collected without the fighter leaving the meditation state.

## Renting

Renting allows the Master to passively earn fees from other users by providing the services of his fighters and arenas. The corresponding fee rates (battle entry percentage and minimum fee) are determined by the Master. The fees are paid by the user borrowing a fighter or arena and can be claimed by the owner once the battle is finished. While the fighters and arenas are rented they can not be used for battles or enter meditation. Fighters that are borrowed and take part in battles earn 50% of the experience points that they would earn if they entered the battle with their own Master.
