# ðŸ¥Š Combat rules

The combat between Acolytes proceeds in turns. There is a maximum of 12 turns, but the battle can end prematurely if the HP of one of the fighters reaches 0. The winning fighter is the one with the higher renaming HP at the end of the battle.

Every turn of the battle each of the two fighters attack with an action selected for that turn. The outcome of the turn is determined on the basis of the relation of the two corresponding elements. There are three possible outcomes:

* **Critical hit**: fighter with the **dominating** element deals 2x base damage to the opponent
* **Energizing hit**: fighter with **overcoming** element deals 1x base damage to the opponent and receives 3x base FP
* **Stalemate**: both fighters selected same element, in which case no effects are triggered

The fighter that scores a hit against his opponet also activates a skill if it is available; that is, if the skill belongs to the same element as his action and is fully charged (i.e. has accumulated the required amount of FP). If multiple skills are available the first (i.e. left-most) one is selected.
