# ⚙️ Battle system

The battles in Godai follow a strict ancient creed. It is based on the fundamental interplay of the five elements and fighters' abilities. While the key notions are easy to grasp, mastering the battle system takes serious dedication and loads of training.

## The Elements

The world of Godai consists of five elements: **Eath, Fire, Wood, Water and Metal.** To become a successful warrior, it is first necessary to understand the nature of each element and master the relations between them.
