# ☯️ The Elements

## Relations between the elements

First step in becoming a skillful fighter is gaining the knowledge of the five elements and their relations. There exist three possible types of relations between a given pair of elements:

* Dominating (thick black line)
* Overcoming (thin black line)
* Generating (gray line)

The Acolyte's mastery of a certain element is determined in the number of **attribute points** invested in that element. With each level Acolytes earn additional attribute points that can be spent as their Master sees best fit. The attribute points determine the damage bonus and skill power for the specific element.
